# 📋 NEX: ReadyGo - Project Roadmap

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [x] **IMPORTANT UPDATE- Implement Backend**:

  -1st step: In the same folder NEX, next to CarRentalApp, Implement backend for the project, using NestJS. As explained in the instructions i don't have knowledge in NestJs, but you can still ask questions to make this the best NestJS application for this project. Choose a good name for the BE project.

  -2nd step: Continue to implement all the APIs that FE project needs to consume. Start from Auth, then with booking, catalog, ect ect and basically for every service that consumes BE api that so far has been mocked. I also needs a database, i would prefer a SQL database, and also the implementation of the code is going to based on that, make also the db connection. Choose what db is best for this case and if you need me to do any action for the db connection please ask me. (BTW so far i have only Bruno app installed). Also note that for the project, add a gitignore file because i see 10k files to commit.

  -Improvement: Related to Database and backend development, I think i want to make some changes. First of all i think i may want to use mongodb as a database, so it would make it easier for me for the deployment phase if i intend to do one. So for now I am installin mongodb-compass in my machine.

- [x] **Admin User Management **:

  - In the admin role it should add a new section to manage users.
  - "The admin can see all users, and the the bookings that the user has currently active, has made before and the upcoming, if he has any.
  - Admin can have possibility to add new user and delete new user.

    - [ ] **Unit Test with Vitest**:

  - Gather information on how to implement unit test with Vitest.
  - Update copilot-instructions.md file, to write unit test for every element of the project [Component, Service, Guard, Resolver, Pipe, Interceptor, Directive].
  - Write unit test for every element of the project [Component, Service, Guard, Resolver, Pipe, Interceptor, Directive], with success and 95%-100% coverage.

  - [ ] **Rounded spinning menu for cars**:

  - I have a spinning menu for cars, in another project (https://github.com/JuriLu/AS), and I want to use it here.

    - [ ] **New Component or application for Car Rental businesses?**:

  - TBC

    - [ ] **Moving car animation (Car Entering the garage) when selecting a car**:

  - TBC, also how are the cards going to be displayed? Maybe i should make a new component for the cards, and make them larger to implement a garage and the car entering the garage animation. Make one garage and change the car entering and the car leaving animation when changing the car.

   - [ ] **For car Cards, what should be done with the feature button**:

  - Should it open an popup to show all the features of the car with an animation for each feature?.

     - [ ] **Car form:

  - Should design a method so when a car is created, should also write the features of the car in the database, should check for design and make the necessary changes.

  - Preferences for cabin ambient lighting (matching the UI colors).
  - Digital key management interface.
